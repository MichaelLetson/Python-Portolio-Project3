## For my Milestone Project 3 I have created a Python program to help input and automate data management.

This is for a real world scenario of inputting team data into a spreadsheet, having the option to gain insights and retain/calculate key data. Visit the deployed Heroku page here: https://python-portfolio-project3.herokuapp.com/ 

## Testing

- Code passed through PEP8 validator, via http://pep8online.com/ with 2 issues, which were rectified and the code now passes without issue. The 2 issues were a line length being too long on line 101, and a trailing blank space on line 40. 
- Tried passing program invalid data, e.g. csv length longer than 5. 
- Tested in GitHub terminal.
- Tested in Heroku terminal.
 
 ### Known bugs:
 The commit messages display errors, such as misplaced letters and spelling mistakes. This is due to computer glitches when typing in the commit messages in the terminal. 
 Chose to leave the errors in place, rather than risk losing work by editing the commits.
